whenever (this) key word is appears in the function that function is called constructor function

till now 
1.one object will send into another object we use create.object method .
2.to use constructor function prototype we use constructor .prototype method.
3.one constructor function will assign to another constructor function as a prototype 
// setPrototypeOf---> it can access one constructor function prototype to another constructor function prototype 
// object.create----> it will connect one object to another object as a prototype 
// constructor.prototype ----> it is used to connect prototype as a constructor function directly.
